![VMware Explore 2024 Barcelona Live Broadcast][1]

VMware Explore 2024 Barcelona is just around the corner! Next week, thousands will gather in Spain for this exciting conference.  While there will be many great sessions from various vendors and the VMware community, I highly recommend checking out the sessions on Google Cloud VMware Engine.

As a Cloud Engineer working with customers, I've seen firsthand how Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE) is a top choice for those looking to begin their Google Cloud journey.

I've compiled a list of all the sessions where the GCVE team will be showcasing our solution.  Also, make sure to stop by booth 305 to chat with me or another GCVE expert.

Hope to see you in Barcelona!
